%Code that produces a randomly generated number that follows the bernoulli
%distribution for an arbitrary likelihood of success parameter, p.  That is
%to say, the script generates a number that is a function of how many times
%a coin is successfully flipped before a failure.  The number can be
%adjusted, but is the vector m.  In this case, the values of m are 1, 2,
%3, 4....etc.  And the probability of each value of m is assigned as 
%follows:  P(m)=2^(-m)

for n = 1:10000
p = 0.5;
success = 0;
m(n) = 1;
    while success == 0
        A = rand;
        if A < p
            success=1;
        else
            m(n) = m(n)+1;
        end
    
    end
%result(n)=rand*p(n);%this is a matrix of binomially distributed random nums
end
%verify distribution with plot and with the probability of occurencce of
%some of the values of the variable
hist(m)

%the below values check the likelihood of m being 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
p1 = sum(m==1)/n;
p2 = sum(m==2)/n;
p3 = sum(m==3)/n;
p4 = sum(m==4)/n;
p5 = sum(m==5)/n;
